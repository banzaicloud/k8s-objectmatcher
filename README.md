# Kubernetes object matcher

K8S-ObjectMatcher is a Golang library which helps to match Kubernetes objects.

### Motivation

Here at Banzai Cloud we love and write lots of Kubernetes [operators](https://github.com/banzaicloud?utf8=âœ“&q=operator&type=&language=). While writing some complex operators as the [Istio](https://github.com/banzaicloud/istio-operator) , [Vault](https://github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults) or [Kafka](https://github.com/banzaicloud/kafka-operator) operator, we encountered a huge amount of **unnecessary Kubernetes object updates**. Most of the operators out there are using `reflect.DeepEquals` to match the given object's `Spec`. Unfortunately, this solution is not perfect because every Kubernetes object is amended with different default values while submitted. This library aims to provide finer object matching capabilities to avoid unnecessary updates and more observability on the client side.

### Supported Objects

### How to use it

```
objectMatcher := objectmatch.New(logf.NewDelegatingLogger(logf.NullLogger{}))
objectMatcher.Match(e.ObjectOld, e.ObjectNew)
```
